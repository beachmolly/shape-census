# Shape Census

Shape Census is a Python-based tool designed to analyze grids of binary data and identify connected shapes within them. It's like conducting a population count, but for shapes in a digital landscape!

## Project Overview

In the world of Shape Census, we're dealing with a unique kind of population: shapes formed by connected '1's in a sea of '0's. Our census taker (the program) diligently scans through text files containing grids of 0's and 1's, identifying and counting distinct shapes along the way.

Key Features:
- Reads and processes grid data from text files
- Identifies shapes formed by adjacent '1's (up, down, left, right connections)
- Counts the total number of distinct shapes in each grid
- Handles varying grid sizes efficiently

Whether you're dealing with a small town of shapes (data_small.txt) or a bustling metropolis (data_large.txt), Shape Census is up to the task. It's not just about counting â€“ it's about understanding the topography of your data landscape.

Perfect for data analysts, puzzle enthusiasts, or anyone intrigued by the hidden patterns in binary grids. Shape Census turns the abstract world of 0's and 1's into a captivating exploration of form and connection.
